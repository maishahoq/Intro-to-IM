##### Inspiration
___
I was inspired by the early 2000s action animes, where the introduction would be a lot of frames of the characters moving on screen, in a very systemic order, that it does not look all over the place.
I tried incorporating the conditional statement, if-else, to fluctuate between the shapes for pattern art incorporating the keyPressed function, butwas not successful.

Mathematical reasoning:
functions used: sine function and cosine function
Sine and cosine are alternating trigonometric functions that return smoother frequency values with the increase of angle. I needed a circular function that would increment and decrement with the increase of x or input, for a smoother transition of the overlapping shapes to make a systemic pattern. So, I used trigonometric functions instead of random(). Also, I knew the mathematical output  of sine and cosine functions, so was easier for me to draft a probable output for the positioning of the overlapping shapes.
incrementing variables: variables scalar and angle incremented linearly by a constant speed value in the loop, this ensured a linear motion of the shapes.
