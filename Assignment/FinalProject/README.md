Mental Health: Main Part

Awareness About Pandasâ€™ Extinction: Ending Part
Just at the ending screen, we will have 
Speech recognition [extra f we have time]

Range of good Heart State: 70 BPM to 90 BPM


### Game Description

 Screens:
Start Screen
Measure Pulse and Daily Mood Journal [Choose either]
If Pulse>70 and less than 90 BPM, normal category screen pops up
If Pulse<70 and > 90 BPM, non-normal category screen pops up

Pulse screen:
Normal Category Screen:
      
Non-normal category Screen:
     a. Breathing Meditation b. Guided Meditation c. Affirmation d. 

Daily Mood Journal:
       
      
Always end the cycle with a hug from panda
The game will have two parts: `1.` Algorithm Visualizer
                              `2.` Algorithm Game


__Visualizer:__  This part of the game is instructional and was inspired from the assignment where we did generative art without any interaction from the user. So, there will be visualization of how the different sorting algorithm works based on which algorithm the user chooses.

__Game:__ This part of the game is interactive and was inspired from the assignment where we did generative art with interactions from the user. The user will be able to play the game and try out different algorithms by moving the objects on screen using the cursor.

### Code Snippets:




+ Best Part of Code:

         + Game Modification:   The user can change the change just by changing the values in some of the variables, this will modify the whole code without it breaking anywhere. Example, just changing the no of balls variable, changes the box numbers, places the balls in equal distances, changes the comparisons of positions etc. The values have been barely hardcoded.
         
         + Resuse code from other assignments. I tried mofifying the one of the assignments to fit the game as an intro screen because the assignmnethas animation of balls to it.
         


### Encountered Problems

__1__. The balls were getting vanished behind the ball in my cursor:

Solution: Used "break" keyword inside the if statement of the forloop of mouse dragged to stop from taking any other ball when a ball has been selected.



### Things we have to work on (Problems)
1. When there are multiple inputs at the same time, how to take all of them and seperate out output?
2. 



### Future Additions

__1__.  Adding an instruction animation using code. Due to lack of expertise and time commitment since I am overloading this semester and had a lot of exams and projects due at the same time, I could't do this before. I plan to add this during Spring Break.
