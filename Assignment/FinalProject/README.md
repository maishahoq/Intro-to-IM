Mental Health: Main Part

Awareness About Pandasâ€™ Extinction: Ending Part
Just at the ending screen, we will have 
Speech recognition [extra f we have time]

Range of good Heart State: 70 BPM to 90 BPM


### Game Description

 Screens:
Start Screen
Panda at the bottom needs animation; If you click on this panda, we will be taken to a panda awareness screen.
Measure Pulse and Daily Mood Journal [Choose either]
If Pulse>70 and less than 90 BPM, normal category screen pops up
If Pulse<70 and > 90 BPM, non-normal category screen pops up
Screen-3:Click on anxiety tracker and it takes you to pulse measuring screen 
It will store all the pulse values for 1 minute, and give you the average pulse rate.
Based on the difference of the 1st and last pulse of every 10 sec interval, and if the average of these differences is greater than 30, you are very anxious; if less than 30, you are not anxious.
Pulse Screen

Pulse screen:
Non-normal category Screen:
     a. Breathing Meditation[Download Audio Files From Online] b. Guided Meditation [Download Audio Files From Online] c. Affirmation [Download Audio Files From Online]
           Normal Category Screen:
     Always end the cycle with a hug from panda


Daily Mood Journal: [Extra part]
       
    
The game will have two parts: `1.` Algorithm Visualizer
                              `2.` Algorithm Game

__Visualizer:__  This part of the game is instructional and was inspired from the assignment where we did generative art without any interaction from the user. So, there will be visualization of how the different sorting algorithm works based on which algorithm the user chooses.

__Game:__ This part of the game is interactive and was inspired from the assignment where we did generative art with interactions from the user. The user will be able to play the game and try out different algorithms by moving the objects on screen using the cursor.

### Code Snippets:




+ Best Part of Code:

         + Game Modification:   The user can change the change just by changing the values in some of the variables, this will modify the whole code without it breaking anywhere. Example, just changing the no of balls variable, changes the box numbers, places the balls in equal distances, changes the comparisons of positions etc. The values have been barely hardcoded.
         
         + Resuse code from other assignments. I tried mofifying the one of the assignments to fit the game as an intro screen because the assignmnethas animation of balls to it.
         


### Encountered Problems




### Future Additions

__1__.  Adding an instruction animation using code. Due to lack of expertise and time commitment since I am overloading this semester and had a lot of exams and projects due at the same time, I could't do this before. I plan to add this during Spring Break.

### Questions:
How to stop taking values from arduino?
How to switch between multiple inputs from arduino?


### Roadmap
1. Get the 4 sensor data from Arduino
2. The p5.js 1st screen changes to 2nd screen after 10s of starting the program (cuz it takes sometime for the pulse sensor to start taking correct values as input) .
3.
