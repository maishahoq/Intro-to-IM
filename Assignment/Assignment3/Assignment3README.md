#### Inspiration 

I couldn't think of anything creative last week, and either from the stress of workload or my migraine, I felt like I was in a creative block, with bubbles crowding  in my headspace. Thus, I just decided to draw what I felt like, using colors I felt matched my situation.
The bubles have a trasparent feauture because of how foggy and clody they are in my head.


#### Generative Pattern Art
#### Encountered Problems

I wanted to use the sine curve for the boundary of my headspace, and to also give off a structure of hair, but was not able to coordinate the translate function to the sine curve to get a diagonal hair structure or diagonally moving sine wave, so, used a line instead
