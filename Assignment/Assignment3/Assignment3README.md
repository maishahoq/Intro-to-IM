#### Inspiration 

I couldn't think of anything creative last week, and either from the stress of workload or my migraine, I felt like I was in a creative block, with bubbles crowding  in my headspace. Thus, I just decided to draw what I felt like, using colors I felt matched my situation.
The bubles have a trasparent feauture because of how foggy and clody they are in my head.
