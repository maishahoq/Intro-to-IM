### Inspiration 



I was learning different algorithms to make code efficient, which included shortest path finding algorithms (ex - Dijkstra's algorithm) and sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort etc. Although there are many resources online, both articles and instruction videos, I couln't find any interactive platform to 1. Learn 2. Apply my understanding i.e practice my learnings. That's why, for this project, I am planning to build an educational game.




### Game Description




The game will have two parts: `1.` Algorithm Visualizer 
                              `2.` Algorithm Game

__Visualizer:__  This part of the game is instructional and was inspired from the assignment where we did generative art without any interaction from the user. So, there will be visualization of how the different sorting algorithm works based on which algorithm the user chooses.

__Game:__ This part of the game is interactive and was inspired from the assignment where we did generative art with interactions from the user. The user will be able to play the game and try out different algorithms by moving the objects on screen based
