***     

#### Inspiration 

I was learning different algorithms to make code efficient, which included shortest path finding algorithms (ex - Dijkstra's algorithm) and sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort etc. Although there are many resources online, both articles and instruction videos, I couln't find any interactive platform to 1. Learn 2. Apply my understanding i.e practice my learnings. That's why, for this project, I am planning to build an educational game.


#### Description

The game will have two parts: `1.` Algorithm Visualizer 
                              `2.` Algorithm Game

**Algorithm Visualizer: **
